* The most intakes occurred in the areas with the fewest vet clinics. 
* In urban areas with a higher concentration of vet clinics, the number of intakes increased again to higher levels, a trend which could be explained simply by a higher concentration of animals in  more densely-populated areas. 
* In one suburban area with the highest concentration of vet clinics, there was a very low intake count.
