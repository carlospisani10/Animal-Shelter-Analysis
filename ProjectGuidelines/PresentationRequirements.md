# Presentation Requirements

This document outlines [Requirements](#requirements) and [Structural Suggestions](#structural-suggestions) for project presentations.

## <a name='requirements'></a> Requirements

The presentation requirements for Project 1 are as follows. 

Your presentation must:

* Be at least 8-10 min. long

* Describe the questions you and your group found interesting, and what motivated you to answer them

* Summarize where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions

* Describe the data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

* Describe the analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)

* Summarize your conclusions. This should include a numerical summary (i.e., what data did your analysis yield), as well as visualizations of that summary (plots of the final analysis data)

* Discuss the implications of your findings. This is where you get to have an open-ended discussion about what your findings "mean"&mdash;why do they matter? What can you use them for? Why are they interesting?

## <a name='#structural-suggestions'></a> Structural Suggestions

You are free to structure your presentations to your liking, but students tend to have succes with the following format.

  * Describe whether you were able to answer these questions to your satisfication, and briefly summarize your findings

* Questions &amp; Data

* Data Cleanup &amp; Exploration
  * Describe the exploration and cleanup process
  * Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate
  * Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during exploration, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Data Analysis
  * Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during analysis, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Discussion
  * Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?

* Post Mortem
  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them
